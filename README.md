# WindowFormCatalog
group of windows forms using .net framework I programmed for my Global Intelligence Technology Academy (GITA) course 
NOTE I'm pretty sure this only works on windows but if it works on other os's then please tell me
# How to run
go to the dir("folder") of the project you want to run then go to bin/debug/ and you should find a .exe to use, click it and run.
